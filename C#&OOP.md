2. Heap stored reference types.

# Inheritance
Same object with different behavior . we use inheritance to increase reusibiltiy, extendibility, and modify.

# Interface Vs Abstract Class
1. Abstract Class : only allows other classes to inherit from it but cannot be instantiated. In other words its a contract that defines specific set of methods and their arguments.
2. Interface :  interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.

The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class.
