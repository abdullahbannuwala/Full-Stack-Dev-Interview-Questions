# Differentiate between Boxing and Unboxing?
Boxing : Converting value type to reference type. 
Unboxing : Converting reference type to value type.

# Managed and unmanaged code.
Managed : Code writen in C# , that need Common language runtime is called managed code. We cant execute this code directly on OS.
Unmanage : Code written in c, c++ is that execute directly on OS.

# Constants Vs Read-only
1. Constant : Value type + Initalize at Compile Time
2. Read Only : Reference type + Initalize at Run Time

# Reflection 
1. The process of describing the metadata of types, methods and fields in a code. 
2. System.Reflection enables you to obtain data about the loaded assemblies, the elements within them like classes, methods and value types. 

# Why refection?
1. To get all global and non-global methods defined in the module.
2. To get method info to look at information such as parameters, name, return type, access modifiers and implementation details.
3. To get event info to find out the event-handler data type, the name, declaring type and custom attributes.
4. To get Constructor Info parameters, access modifiers, and implementation details of a constructor.
5. To get property info.


# Dynamic keyword
1. Skip type-checking at compiler time.
2. Delay type-checking until runtime.

# Reflection Vs Dynamic?
1. Both used when we want to operate on an object during runtime.
2. Reflection can invoke both public and private members of an object while dynamic can only invoke public members.
3. Dynamic is instance specific: you don't have access to static members; you have to use Reflection in those scenarios.

# Stack Vs Heap.
1. Stack stored value types.
2. Heap stored reference types.

Ref VS Out
1. Ref:  The parameter or argument must be initialization first before it is passed to ref.
2. Out:  It is compulsory to initialize a parameter or argument before it is passed to an out.



# Inheritance
Same object with different behavior . we use inheritance to increase reusibiltiy, extendibility, and modify.

# Interface Vs Abstract Class
1. Abstract Class : only allows other classes to inherit from it but cannot be instantiated. In other words its a contract that defines specific set of methods and their arguments.
2. Interface :  interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.

The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class. 

# Delegates
A obA=new A();
Here, the object reference obA points to an object of A. Similar to this, delegates 
are reference types, but the key difference is that they point to methods. Simply put, 
a delegate is an object that knows how to invoke a method. A delegate derives from 
System.Delegate class
